# hello-world

Hi Human!

Tbeltran here, I like Python and Bootstrap, I'm really learning them right now ;)
To edit files I'm trying to get the most of Atom, but, as I am behind a hard proxy, to add packages to Atom it needs an extra configuration or creation of new bins, I'm starting to understand what it is necessary to do.
