# hello-world

Hi Humans!

Tbeltran here, I like Python and Bootstrap, I'm really learning them right now ;)
To edit files I'm trying to get the most of Atom (atom.io), but as I am behind a hard proxy, to add packages to Atom it's necesary to do extra configurations or the creation of a complete new bin (I hope not have to do it), just I'm starting to understand what the hell should be necessary for.
